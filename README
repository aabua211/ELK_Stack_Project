## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the _______ file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

  - Filebeat-Playbook.yml

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly _____, in addition to restricting _____ to the network.
- _TODO: What aspect of security do load balancers protect? They protect against DDOS attacks by managing loads on servers. What is the advantage of a jump box? It’s a single entry point for users which helps to filter who’s entering and allows extra layers of defense.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the _____ and system _____.
- _TODO: What does Filebeat watch for? For Files and Logs locations.
The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
_Note: Use the [Markdown Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to add/remove values from the table_.

| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  | 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |
| ELK-Server            10.1.0.5     Linux  |          |            |                  | Blissful_Kepler       10.0.0.5     Linux   Ansible Container
|    |          |            |                  |
|    |          |            |                  |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the _____ machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- JumpBox 68.84.78.0


Machines within the network can only be accessed by _____.
- _TODO: Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM? Blissful Kepler What was its IP address? 13.90.211.242

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes/No              | 10.0.0.4 10.0.0.5    |
|          |                     |                      |
|          |                     |                      |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- _TODO: What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible? Less room for human error.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- _TODO: In 3-5 bullets, explain the steps of the ELK installation play.
•	Install Docker
•	Install python3-pip
•	Install Docker python module
•	Use more momory
•	Download and launch docker elk container

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
•	10.0.0.4 Jumpbox
•	10.0.0.5 Web-1
•	10.0.0.6 Web-2
•	10.1.0.5 ELK-Server

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
Filebeat-Playbook.yml
Filebeat.yml
Filebeat-config.yml
Metricbeat.yml


These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
Filebeat is used primarily for collected files and logs locations while the metricbeat is used to collect metrics and statistics from operating systems and services running on the server.

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the _____ file to _____.
- Update the _____ file to include...
- Run the playbook, and navigate to ____ to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? Filebeat-playbook.yml Where do you copy it? /etc/ansible/files
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? Hosts.yml How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?_By listing [elk] or [websevers] above the designated IP addresses.
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running? http://13.66.252.173:5601/app/kibana

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._
